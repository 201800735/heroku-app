Creating a new page is a simple affair in **Grav**.  Simply follow these simple steps:

1. Navigate to your pages folder: `user/pages/` and create a new folder.  In this example, we will use [explicit default ordering](http://learn.getgrav.org/content/content-pages) and call the folder `02.mypage`.
2. Launch your text editor and paste in the following sample code:

        ---
        title: My New Page
        ---
        # My New Page!

        This is the body of **my new page** and I can easily use _Markdown_ syntax here.

3. Save this file in the `user/pages/02.mypage/` folder as `default.md`. This will tell **Grav** to render the page using the **default** template.
4. That is it! Reload your browser to see your new page in the menu.

&gt;&gt; NOTE: The page will automatically show up in the Menu after the "Home" menu item. If you wish to change the name that shows up in the Menu, simple add: `menu: My Page` between the dashes in the page content. This is called the YAML front matter, and it is where you configure page-specific options.</code></pre>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
