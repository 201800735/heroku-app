#About Us

Reno Real Estate Team is led by the husband and wife team of Gene and Johanne Reno, real estate experts with more than 10 years of experience. We specialize in buying, selling, and investing in real estate. We target San Joaquin County and the greater Northern California market. We also assist our clients with out-of-state investments, relocations, and vacation homes, both nationally and internationally. Our specialties include the first-time home buyer, the first-time home seller, families in the process of relocating, and investors.

We help buyers find the perfect home for their specific needs and goals. Our interviewing process for all buyers facilitates our communication and allows us to identify their specific criteria, including what neighborhood they prefer to buy in, what school district they want to live in, and what size home will best serve their needs. We guide first time buyers through the process of purchasing a home, from presenting an offer to scheduling an inspection. We also help investors find their dream vacation home, from the high country of Telluride to tropical Belize.

We help sellers prepare their listings and sell their home for the highest price in the shortest period of time with the least amount of stress. Reno Real Estate Team is available for every aspect of the home-selling process, from offering advice on pricing and negotiating offers on the seller’s behalf to coordinating appraisals and monitoring the buyer’s loan process. We walk door-to-door to communicate an open house to the neighborhood, market newly listed properties with post cards, and go above and beyond our client’s expectations to sell their home.

We believe in creating a relationship with our clients and helping them reach their short and long-term real estate goals with a focus on personalized custom care. We are a full service team, and offer referrals for every aspect of moving into a new home: inspectors, title companies, general contractors, painters, plumbers, electricians and landscapers.

Reno Real Estate Team is community-oriented and actively involved with the Lodi Chamber of Commerce. Johanne is an ambassador with the Chamber and part of Leadership Lodi, a 10-month leadership program. Both Gene and Johanne volunteer with Partners in Education (PIE), a program which links businessmen and women with local students as mentors.

Reno Real Estate Team is a member of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the California Association of Realtors (CAR), and the Lodi Association of Realtors (LAR). We are also affiliated with the Central Valley Association of Realtors (CVAR).
