  - title: We find the Perfect Home.
    description: We help buyers find the perfect home for their specific needs and goals. Our interviewing process for all buyers facilitates our communication and allows us to identify their specific criteria, including what neighborhood they prefer to buy in, what school district they want to live in, and what size home will best serve their needs. We guide first time buyers through the process of purchasing a home, from presenting an offer to scheduling an inspection. We also help investors find their dream vacation home, from the high country of Telluride to tropical Belize.

  - title: Helping sellers get the Best results.
    description: We help sellers prepare their listings and sell their home for the highest price in the shortest period of time with the least amount of stress. Reno Real Estate Team is available for every aspect of the home-selling process, from offering advice on pricing and negotiating offers on the seller’s behalf to coordinating appraisals and monitoring the buyer’s loan process. We walk door-to-door to communicate an open house to the neighborhood, market newly listed properties with post cards, and go above and beyond our client’s expectations to sell their home.
