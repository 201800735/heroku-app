![Johanne Reno]()
##Johanne Reno
Johanne was born in Montreal, Canada and is bi-lingual in French and English. Her love of real estate goes back to her youth in Canada. On the weekends, she would often take her younger brother along with her to visit model homes and show him the properties, walking him through each room and explaining the features.

She developed her strong business background from more than 10 years of teaching at a business college prior to entering the real estate field. Johanne first worked as a transaction coordinator for Gene, and then went on to get her real estate license.

Johanne’s specialities include first-time home buyers and sellers, relocating families, and investors. Considered a home pricing specialist, Johanne’s goal is to use top pricing and marketing strategies to help clients sell their homes quickly.

##Gene Reno
Gene studied psychology and business at California State University, Stanislaus. He first worked in medical finance before a friend recommended he pursue real estate. The idea of owning his own business and independence appealed to him, so he entered the real estate business in 2004.

With a people-oriented focus and strong passion for real estate, Gene’s goal is to be of service to others as they make one of the greatest investments of their lives. He has more than 10 years experience helping buyers and sellers reach their goals, and he likes the challenges of the fast-paced business along with helping clients navigate the process.
